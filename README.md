# PyImgurGrabber
A small python script to grab screenshots, upload them to Imgur, make the link available in the clipboard and then remove them after a period of time.

To use this, please see my blog entry at: http://logicalmoon.com/2015/04/creating-an-imgur-snapchat-like-screen-capture-tool-in-python/

You will need:

1. Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. To install these packages:
  pip install pyperclip
  pip install pyimgur
3. Have downloaded the excellent MiniCap screen capture program (http://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Mouser/MiniCap/) and installed it into a sub-directory called bin.
4. Have set up an application on Imgur to get a client ID
5. Set the ID field in the Python script
